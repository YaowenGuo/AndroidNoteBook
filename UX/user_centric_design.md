# User centric design

How to make applications the people love to use by focusing in on your end user. The First lesson we are focusing on the software. But now we are going to start focusing on the person. So we need to ask ourselves, who is our end user? Or who are we making this application for?

> How do we focus on the user?
There are tow things.

1. How to design applications for specific type of user, or a persona and their user cases.
2. How to build a feature list that's tailored for your persona and your user case. to make sure that your application will really delight your user.

## persona

When you want to make a new application the first step is to make a list feature what will for you application usually. Different people have different ideas. There will be a three different feature list if you have a three designer. How do we decide which feature will take in our application ?

We are easily to let our personal biases and opinions and preferences really effect this feature list. This is a really common problem, and it is a very bad things. But this even happens to experienced Android  designer and developers with no user in mind.

So what is the best feature list set for our application?

- One solutions is we can combine all feature.
- Pick one feature list.

But they are really bad options. Combine all the feature list are going to kind of have an application that doesn't really please anyone. When your try to please every one, you end up please no one. But if select one list you maybe represent you not your user.

Thus we must focus on user-centric design. We design a product with a specific user in mind. One of the keys to user-centric design is overcoming our own biases.
But
- A developer: Will think how to implement the application by widget and graphics API because the want to build it right now.
- A designer: Will imagine a user is user your application and the have the final target. When they open an application, What is the flow we could create in an application that would let then get the final target as quickly as possible, with as little friction as possible, and make them happy.

But the way we really want to go is not exactly a developer approach or the designer approach. We want to do something that kind of meets in the middle.

           developer + designer => Development minded designer

Design something really really great, empathize with your user, but keep in constraints that whether you can really build this.

- Another very important thing is the designer and the designer are very familiar with software, we are not think as same as user. When we are building things, we have a certain bias.

       We  != User

Before we design and development, to make sure you are building in the right direction. The only way you can do that is to aware of the users. So you deed to start thinking who is this audience that I'm building this things for? How can I understand them, How can I make sure that the things I'm excited about, these user cases that I'm thinking about, really line up with what their goals, And what the need of the user are?
persona and user case: A way to understand the user attributes and behaviors.
persona: Proxy of a group actual users of product, for whom the UX is going to optimized.
User Case: When + where + How a persona to use your product to accomplish a task.
- One way is through the use of a `persona`. Just try to build out how your model of how this person other than yourself, one of your uses. Just more information about them and kind of what their goals and what their contexts of user are.
- Next step is to think how do they act with your product? One way you capture that them completing a task, is through a `user case`. what are the steps they go through to complete a specific sub-goal.
So you have your personas, and you have your user cases. How do they influence the way you treat development?  
- Refer to those persona whenever you can.
- Try to talk to the specific user cases.
- To make a clear kind of gulf between what I personally think and what I as a designer representing these personas.

Exa:
A user attributes use pizza App:
- a collage student.
- doesn't have a lot of money.
- live in the dorm.
- doesn't have a car.

=>

The very important is you shouldn't denature attributes(put in incompatible attributes yourself). it makes the persona really imprecise it doesn't make a good product.
