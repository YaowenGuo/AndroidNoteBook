# User centric design

How to make applications the people love to use by focusing in on your end user. The First lesson we are focusing on the software. But now we are going to start focusing on the person. So we need to ask ourselves, who is our end user? Or who are we making this application for?

> How do we focus on the user?
There are tow things.

1. How to design applications for specific type of user, or a persona and their user cases.
2. How to build a feature list that's tailored for your persona and your user case. to make sure that your application will really delight your user.

## persona

When you want to make a new application the first step is to make a list feature what will for you application usually. Different people have different ideas. There will be a three different feature list if you have a three designer. How do we decide which feature will take in our application ?

We are easily to let our personal biases and opinions and preferences really effect this feature list. This is a really common problem, and it is a very bad things. But this even happens to experienced Android  designer and developers with no user in mind.

So what is the best feature list set for our application?

- One solutions is we can combine all feature.
- Pick one feature list.

But they are really bad options. Combine all the feature list are going to kind of have an application that doesn't really please anyone. When your try to please every one, you end up please no one. But if select one list you maybe represent you not your user.

Thus we must focus on user-centric design. We design a product with a specific user in mind. One of the keys to user-centric design is overcoming our own biases.
